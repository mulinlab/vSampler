## vSampler
   vSampler is a fast, scalable and versatile tool for sampling matched sets of variants both as a web server and as a local program. Given input variants, vSampler can randomly draw control variants with eight optional matching properties and tissue/cell type-specific annotations by a novel data structure and searching algorithm. These matched random controls could be used to construct null distribution in enrichment/colocalization analysis to estimate the significance of statistical tests empirically or serve as negative training/test data for pathogenic/regulatory variant prediction models. vSampler runs significantly faster and supports both single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions and deletions (Indels). It also provides comprehensive context-specific functional annotations as matching properties.
